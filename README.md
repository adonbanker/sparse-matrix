# sparse-matrix
This Java program checks whether a 3Ã—3 matrix is a sparse matrix. It takes matrix elements as input, counts the number of zero and non-zero elements, and prints the matrix. If the number of zero elements is greater than the number of non-zero elements, it identifies the matrix as sparse.
